# Nebula: High-Level Expressiveness, Native Performance.

![Nebula Logo Placeholder](https://placehold.co/800x200/020202/FFFFFF?text=Nebula)

Nebula is a modern, statically-typed, object-oriented programming language designed for developers who demand both the elegant syntax of high-level languages and the raw speed of native code. By intelligently transpiling directly to optimized C/C++, Nebula empowers you to build performant, reliable, and portable applications without compromising on developer experience.

## ‚ú® Why Nebula?

Tired of choosing between developer productivity and blazing-fast execution? Nebula offers a compelling alternative:

* **‚ö°Ô∏è Native Performance:** Zero VM overhead. Your Nebula code becomes optimized C/C++ binaries, delivering near-native speed and predictable resource usage.
* **‚úçÔ∏è Clean & Familiar Syntax:** Borrowing the best from Java and C#, Nebula provides intuitive class structures, properties, namespaces, and modern language constructs that feel instantly familiar.
* **üéØ Strong Typing & Compile-Time Safety:** Catch errors early with a robust static type system, ensuring more reliable applications.
* **üöÄ Cross-Platform Potential:** Write once, transpile, and compile for any platform supported by C++ compilers.
* **üõ†Ô∏è Productive Tooling Philosophy:** Designed for a streamlined development workflow, from powerful loop constructs to expressive error handling.

## üí° How It Works

Nebula isn't an interpreted language or one that runs on a custom virtual machine. Instead, it leverages the power of existing C/C++ compilers through a sophisticated **transpilation process**:

1.  **Nebula Source (`.neb`)**: You write your application code in Nebula, benefiting from its high-level features and clear syntax.
2.  **The Nebula Transpiler**: Our custom-built transpiler takes your `.neb` files and converts them into semantically equivalent, highly optimized C/C++ `.hpp` and `.cpp` source files. This includes transforming Nebula's advanced features (like C#-style properties, specific loop syntaxes, and optional parameters) into idiomatic C++ constructs.
3.  **Nebula JDK Integration**: A significant portion of Nebula's standard library (the "JDK") is actually written in Nebula itself! This is then transpiled to C++ and linked with a minimal C++ runtime that handles the absolute lowest-level operations.
4.  **Native C++ Compilation**: The generated C/C++ code, along with the transpiled Nebula JDK and the minimal runtime, is then compiled by your standard C/C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC, etc.) into a lean, native executable.

The result is a self-contained binary that runs directly on your target system, delivering the performance you need without the overhead of a large runtime environment.

## üöÄ Key Features

Here's a closer look at what Nebula brings to the table:

* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
    * **Classes, Fields, Methods, Constructors:** Standard OOP building blocks with `public` and `private` access modifiers.
    * **Getters and Setters (C#-style Properties):** Define concise properties with underlying backing fields and custom logic for data access.
    * **Inheritance (`extends`):** Facilitates code reuse and establishes "is-a" relationships.
    * **Interfaces (`interface`, `implements`):** Define contracts for polymorphic behavior, allowing multiple interface implementation.
    * **Abstract Classes and Methods:** Create base classes with abstract behavior that must be implemented by subclasses.

* **Code Organization**
    * **Namespaces:** Organize your code logically to prevent naming collisions and improve modularity, similar to C# namespaces.

* **Advanced Type System & Method Design**
    * **Explicit Static Type System:** Strong typing for early error detection and enhanced reliability.
    * **Method Overloading by Return Type:** Uniquely allows methods to be overloaded based on their return type, enabling more precise function definitions (e.g., `float getPi()` and `double getPi()`).

* **Flexible Control Flow**
    * **Standard Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`):** All the traditional looping constructs you'd expect.
    * **Simplified `for` Loops:** Convenient shorthand like `for (i < 10)` (iterates `i` from 0 to 9) and `for (j = 5 < 15)` (iterates `j` from 5 to 14), automatically handling initialization and increment/decrement.

* **Modern Language Constructs**
    * **Operator Overloading:** Define custom behavior for standard operators on your own classes, making code more intuitive (e.g., `Vector2 + Vector2`).
    * **Tuples:** Easily group and return multiple, possibly different types of values from methods.
    * **Optional Parameters:** Define method and constructor parameters that can be omitted by the caller. Values for omitted parameters are either `null` (for reference types) or a specified default, easily handled with the `??` (null-coalescing) operator.

* **Application Structure**
    * **`main` Entry Point:** Standardized `public static void main()` method for application startup.

* **Developer Convenience**
    * **Alias Feature:** Create `global` or `local` aliases for long or frequently used method calls (e.g., `global alias println = System.Console.WriteLine;`).

* **Robust Error Handling**
    * **`try-catch-finally` Blocks:** Familiar structure for handling exceptions and ensuring cleanup.
    * **Exception Hierarchy:** Root `Throwable` with `Error` for unrecoverable issues and `Exception` for recoverable ones (all `Exception` subclasses are unchecked for simplicity).
    * **Result Types for Expected Errors:** Encourages the use of `Result<T, E>` (similar to Rust) for anticipated failure scenarios, making error handling explicit and part of the normal control flow.
    * **RAII Philosophy:** Leverages C++'s Resource Acquisition Is Initialization for efficient and automatic resource cleanup, complementing `finally` blocks.
